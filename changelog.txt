# 20.01.05 - 20.04.10 #
	- Implemented classes 'Vector2' and 'Vector2d' in 'geometry_utils.h' header
	- Implemented class 'Rectangle' in 'geomentry_utils.h' header
	- Implemented basic 'Graphics' class using SDL2 and SDL2_images
	- Implemented 'consolelog' namespace containing functions for convenient debug printing
	- Implemented basic 'Game' class
	- Implemented class 'Input' for convenient polling and storage of events
	- Implemented 'globalconsts' namespace that stores hardcoded values
	- Implemented class 'Entity', capable of displaying static sprites and playing animations
	- Implemented class 'PhysicalEntity', containing basic physics logic
	- Implemented class 'Player' derived from 'PhysicalEntity'
	- Implemented class 'Level'. Levels are loaded from .TMX files, tilesets are
	embedded inside the map file. Map size is fixed and is identical to screen size
	due to static camera (or rather, a lack of camera)
	- Implemented header 'level_objects.h', containing classes corresponding to various
	objects (aka level exits, for now)

# 20.06.17 - 20.07.04 #
	- Changed map format from .TMX to .JSON, 'tinyxml' was abandoned in favor of
	'nlohmann_json' for parsing new format
	- Redone and optimised level parsing, tilesets are now stored externally instead of being
	embedded in a map file. Tilisets are stored as .JSON, parsing happens inside the tileset class
	itself
	- Implemented 'Tileset' and 'Tile' classes, tile objects are now unique and independent objects,
	rather than being an id referring to a tileset object
	- Improved tile system: tiles now have an optional 'interaction' member, that handles unique
	tile interaction. All interactive tiles are unique classes derived from regular 'Tile',
	storage and logic is handled via the use of polymorphism
	- Implemented static (aka global) access to Graphics object through static pointer. Deduced further
	applications of this feature and implemented such access to a 'Game' object. Objects with such
	access are initialized before the creation of 'Game' object
	- Implemented 'TileStorage' class that stores loaded tilesets inside an object to prevent repetitive
	loading of the same tilesets while changing levels

# 20.07.05 #
	- Implemented movable camera
	- New methods were added to 'Rectangle' class

# 20.07.06 #

# 20.07.08 #

	- Implemented custom map size (previously, size 20x12 was hardcoded)

# 20.07.11 #
	- Implemented ability to work with multiple savefiles
	- Implemented automatic creation of a new savefiles

	- Started implementing GUI
	- Implemented multiline text display with proper word wrap

	- Fixed a number of incorrect behaviours related to blending of transparent textures, order of rendering,
	texture targeting and texture clearing

# 20.07.16 #
	- Implemented constructor for 'Entity' that uses std::initializer_list for more convenient creation
	- Small changes to 'PhysicalEntity' flags
	- Implemented logic that allows GUI to draw elements as objects on a map (rather than overlay)
	- Improved tile interaction logic - added two-step trigger check: successfull first check puts tile into an 'activated'
	state, successfull second check triggers tile interaction

# 20.07.17 #
	- Minor functionality added to 'Vector2' class
	- Improved GUI text logic
	- GUI now supports numbers and symbols {,.!?-:}
	- Fixed bug that prevented 'Gui::make_text()' from displaying last word of the text

# 20.07.18 #
	- Implemented centered display of single-line text through new method 'make_line_centered()'

# 20.07.20 #
	- Started working on more advanced Entity system: from now on entities will be created and
	handled through 3 headers: 'entity_base.h', 'entity_type.h', 'entity_unique.h' that will
	contain generic methods. Class 'Entity' is drasticaly refactored, it now contains following
	classes: 'Entity::Visuals', 'Entity::Physics' - objects of these classes contains various
	generic methods and variables related to entity logic, 'Entity' objects store pointers
	to these helper clases - given part of logic is not present, 'Entity' holds nullptr
	- Marked all non-usable default constructors as '= delete' - apparently that's a thing

	'make_tile()', 'make_entity()', 'make_item()' by accessing const unordered_map
	of function pointers insteam of if-else chain

	- Small level parsing optimizations
	- Implemented 'LevelSwitch' class

# 20.08.05 #

	- Implemented text color change
	- Implemented smooth text display (with fixed delays between each new symbol appearing)

	- Switched to C++17 standard

# 20.08.08 #
	- Implemented templated container type 'Collection<>'. 'Collection' is a polymorphic container
	with a sole ownership over its content. 'Collection' allows insertion of elements, which provides
	caller with a handle to inserted element that can be used to access or erase the element.
	'Collection' allows convenient iteration without exposing implementation through the use
	of custom iterators
	- Switched to the use of 'Collection<Object>' insted of 'std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Object>>'
	wherever necessary

	- Added some convenience functions to 'Font' and 'Text'
	- Fixed a bug that made centered text align incorrectly
	- Changed debugging function '_drawEmits()' bypass text system and draw emits directly through font
